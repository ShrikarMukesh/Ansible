Ansible Roles
==============
1. Introduction
==============
=> Role is a Package that contains all required for Running your Playbooks.

=> Role heps you organize your Playbooks.

=> Role Contains Ansible Instructions and dependent Requirements.

=> Roles allow you to re-use common Configuration requirements among multiple Playbooks and even among multiple projects.

=> Roles let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure. 

=> After you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse them and share them with other users.
==================
2. Ansible Role artifacts 
==================
=> Every Role Contains the following artifacts 
	1) tasks
	2) handlers
	3) defaults
	4) vars
	5) files
	6) templates
	7) meta

By default Ansible will look in each directory within a role for a main.yml file for relevant content 

1) tasks
========
=> tasks folder Contains main.yml 
=> You need to write main list of tasks that the role executes in main.yml.

2) handlers
==========
=> handlers folder Contains main.yml 
=> You need to write Reusable tasks called as Handlers in main.yml
=> These handlers will be used within or outside this role.

3) defaults
==========
=> defaults folder Contains main.yml 
=> You need to define default variables for the role in main.yml
=> These variables have the lowest priority of any variables available, and can be easily overridden by any other variable.

4) vars
==========
=> vars folder Contains main.yml 
=> You need to define variables for the role in main.yml

5) files
==========
=> You need to place the files in this folder that the role deploys.

6) templates
==========
=> You need to place the templates in this folder that the role deploys.

7) meta
==========
=> meta folder Contains main.yml 
=> You need to write  metadata for the role in main.yml, including role dependencies.

*** Diagram on Board***

=====================
4. Create First Role - hello_role
=====================
 Use ansible-galaxy command to create a Ansible roles which has the templates to create it. 

Steps 
A) On Local Machine
===================
1) Create the MyWork Directory.
mkdir MyWork
cd MyWork

2) Place following ansible.cfg written in MyWork.

[defaults]

host_key_checking = False
inventory = /home/ubuntu/myjlc/myhosts


B) On Ansible Controller
===================
3) Create the MyWork Directory.
(Note : This MyWork folder contains playbooks and roles folder)
mkdir MyWork
cd MyWork

4)Copy ansible.cfg from local to /home/ubuntu/MyWork

scp ansible.cfg ubuntu@3.128.76.85:/home/ubuntu/MyWork

5) Create hello-playbook.yml under MyWork

touch hello-playbook.yml

6) Create roles Directory under MyWork

mkdir roles
cd roles
7) Create the Role using ansible-galaxy command

roles> ansible-galaxy  init hello-role

8) You can see hello-role is created and observe following directory sructure.

roles $  ls -l

roles $  tree hello-role

mywork/roles $ tree hello-role

hello-role
├── README.md
├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── files
├── handlers
│   └── main.yml

├── templates
├── tests
│   ├── inventory
│   └── test.yml
└── vars
    └── main.yml


9) Remove the folders which are not required

mywork/roles/hello-role $ rm -rf handlers tests meta

10) See the Directory structure after Removing unnecessary

roles $  tree hello-role

mywork/roles $ tree hello-role

hello-role

├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── files
├── tasks
│   └── main.yml
├── templates
└── vars
    └── main.yml

C) On Local Machine
===================
11) Create the Directory structure for hello-role in local machine.

12) Create roles folder in MyWork

13) Create hello-role folder in roles folder

14)  Create defaults folder  hello-role folder

15) Write main.yml in defaults folder as follows.
========
main.yml
========
# defaults variables for hello-role

companyName: Java Learning Center
trainerName: Srinivas Dande
trainerEmail: sri@jlc.com

16)  Create vars folder  hello-role folder

17) Write main.yml in vars  folder as follows.
========
main.yml
========
#  variables for hello-role

courseName: Master DevOps
coursePrice: 15000

18)  Create files folder  hello-role folder

19) Place the required files here
We are considering one file called hellojlc.txt as follows
========
hellojlc.txt 
========
Hello JLC Guys, I am hellojlc.txt
Hello JLC Guys, I am hellojlc.txt

20)  Create templates folder  hello-role folder

21) Place the required template files here
We are considering one file called hello-template.j2 as follows
========
hello-template.j2
========
Welcome to {{ companyName }}

Details of the Course 

Course Name : {{ courseName }}
Course Price : {{ coursePrice }}
Trainer Name : {{ trainerName }}
Trainer Email  : {{ trainerEmail }}

22)  Create tasks folder  hello-role folder

23) Write main.yml in tasks folder as follows.
========
main.yml
========
---
- name: copy template file
  template:
     src: templates/hello-template.j2
     dest: /home/ubuntu/bookStore
 
- name: copy hello file
  copy:
     src: files/hello.txt
     dest: /home/ubuntu/bookStore
 
24) Update hello-playbook.yml to include hello-role developved above
=================
hello-playbook.yml
================
---
- name: Using Hello Role in playbook
  hosts: all
  become: true
  
  roles:
    - role: hello-role

25) Now Every thing on Local. Move to Ansible controller 
=========================================================
  scp  hello-playbook.yml ubuntu@3.144.214.179:/home/ubuntu/mywork
  scp -r  hello-role ubuntu@3.144.214.179:/home/ubuntu/mywork/roles
=========================================================

D) On Ansible Controller
===================
26)Check the Directory Structure and files on Ansible Controller as follows.


27) Run the Playbook

ansible-playbook hello-playbook.yml

ansible all -a "ls -l /home/ubuntu/bookStore"

E) On MyNode1
===================
28) Connect to  MyNode1 

ssh ubuntu@52.15.60.96

29) Check the Files and Content 

cd bookStore
bookStore $ cat hellojlc.txt

bookStore $ cat hello-template.j2
