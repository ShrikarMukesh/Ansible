What is Ansible?
Ans: Ansible is simplest IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning configuration management.

Important Points:
==============
*** Ansible is developed by RedHat.
*** Ansible is implimented in python
*** Ansible can be installed only on Linux machines

==> Ansible communicates with all nodes using SSH.
==> Ansible pushes the instructions to nodes.
==> Instructions sent to Ansible will be converted to python Scripts.
==> Python Scripts will be exeeted on all or desived nodes.
==> Ansible runs the instructions on nodes.
==> Ansible is purely agent-less which means no need to install any ansible software on the nodes.

==> You can write Ansible instructions in 3 ways
	*** Ad-HoC/ Impertive way
	*** Playbooks
	*** Roles

==> You cancan write ansible instructions in YAML

Ansible is Idempotent:
------------------------------
Operation is idempotent if  the result of performming operation once is exactly same as result of performming operation repeatedly.
